4. [Risk Score: 0.50] Preamble
   Reason: Contains risk keyword: void
   Text: In the alternative, he I contended that assuming that sub section (1) was valid even then sub section (4) had to be declared void because it gave arbitrary power to the Commission to pick and choose and secondly because the clause was highly discriminatory in character inasmuch as an evasion, whether substantial or insubstantial, came within its ambit as well as within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act.

5. [Risk Score: 0.50] Preamble
   Reason: Contains risk keyword: void
   Text: ed that persons coming under sub section (4) of section 5 also belonged to the same class and therefore on the same grounds that section also could not be declared void.

6. [Risk Score: 0.50] Preamble
   Reason: Contains risk keyword: void
   Text: For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that sub section (4) of section 5 and the procedure prescribed by the impugned Act in so far as affects the persons proceeded against under that sub section being a piece of discriminatory legislation offends against the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution and is thus void and unenforceable.
